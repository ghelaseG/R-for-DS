# Calling Functions

seq(1, 10)

x <- "hello world"

x <- "hello

y <- seq(1, 10, length.out = 5)

y

#Exercises

#1. Why does this code not work?

my_variable <- 10
my_varable

#Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)

#Answer

#"i" from variable "my_variable" is missing.
