# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS



#INTRODUCTION

#here we are going to use visualisation and transofrmation to explore our data in a systematic way, a task that statisticians call EDA

#Few steps to follow:

#1. Generate questions about your data
#2. Search for answers by visualising, transofrimng, and modeling your data
#3. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions

#EDA is not a process with a strict set of rules, is more a state of mind.
#when starting EDA, you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you
#data cleaning is just one applications of EDA, to do data cleaning you'll need to deploy all the tools of EDA: visualisation, transformation and modeling.
