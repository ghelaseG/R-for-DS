```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE)
```

The chunk `a` is independent.
```{r a}
print(lubridate::now())
x <- 10
```

The chunk `b` depends on `a`.
```{r b, dependson = c("a")}
print(lubridate::now())
y <- x + 2
```

Chunk `c` depends on `a`.
```{r c, dependson = c("a")}
print(lubridate::now())
z <- x * 3
```

And finally, the chunk `d` depends on `c` and `b`:
```{r d, dependson = c("c", "b")}
print(lubridate::now())
w <- y + z
```

After running multiple times, you'll realize that the file is running with the first results.
