## Explore How Diamond Sizes Vary by Cut, Colour and Clarity

Diamonds with low quality tend to be larger:
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(y = carat, x = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Also, diamonds with worse colour tend to be larger:
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(y = carat, x = color)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

And of course, diamonds with worse clarity tend to be larger:
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(y = carat, x = clarity)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
