# Model Basics with modelr

#we are going to use models to partition data into patterns and residuals(residuals represent the difference between observed values and predicted values)
#source Google: Example: If a regression model predicts a student's test score to be 85, and the actual score is 90, the residual is 5. This indicates the model underestimated the score by 5 points.

#strong patterns will hide subtler trends.
