Part IV: MODEL

In the next chapters we use the tools of data wrangling and programming to fit models and see how they work.

The goal of a model is to provide a simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset.

These models help you discover interesting relationships within your data.

In the following chapter, we are given a family of useful tools that allow us to use models to understand data.

Hypothesis generation vs Hypothesis confirmation

We are using models as a tool for exploration.

The focus of modeling is on inference (or confirming is true):
- observation can be used as many times for exploration or once for confirmation.

Exploratory analysis can never be confirmatory analysis.

Data can be split into 3 pieces:
- 60% goes into training
- 20% goes into query set (compare models by hand)
- 20% held for test set (use it once to test the final model, but still need to do eda)
